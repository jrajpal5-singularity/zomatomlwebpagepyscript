Hi, In this repository i have taken the data of zomato from keggle to get various information about the restaurants

On analysis; I found three key features i.e. latitude, longitude and star rating of the restaurant. Now using these features; i'll try to find the cost for food for 2 people. 

Later I have created a webpage using pyscripts to show the output results

final result: rating = 3.0,latitude = 12.24, longitude = 15.66
